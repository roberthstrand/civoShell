# civoShell

Civo.com is a UK based cloud platform provider, with a developer and community focused approach. I found them through their #kube100 beta that they run to promote their managed Kubernetes service, running on k3s.

Feel free to sign up for an account ([referal link](https://www.civo.com/?ref=c57484)), or sign up for the [#kube100](https://www.civo.com/kube100) beta.

_Note that this is very much a work in progress. I will be adding more and more functionality, comments and documentation, and automatic testing soon. Until the module is published, you would need to download the code and import it manually. This will hopefully change soon._
